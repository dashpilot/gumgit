# gumgit
Sell software straight from your private Github repo, payment via Gumroad, deployment via Vercel

## How To

1. In Gumroad, create a new application: https://app.gumroad.com/settings/advanced and an access token
2. Clone this repo and deploy it to Vercel, create an environment variable `GR_TOKEN` with the Gumroad access token you received in step one
3. Create a new product on Gumroad and choose `redirect to URL after purchase` as the delivery method
4. Set the URL to https://{your-project-name}.vercel.app/api/download
5. Done! All files in the `dist`-folder will automatically be zipped and downloaded once a user purchases your product!

I have not yet found out how to zip/download files that are generated by a build step (and if that's possible at all via Vercel). So for now, this only works for source files, or files you've built and committed ahead of time. You can however also include extra files at run time (see api/download.js), which opens up possibilities for user-generated content.
